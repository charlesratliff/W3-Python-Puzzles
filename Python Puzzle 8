##Write a Python program to find list integers containing exactly four distinct values, such that no integer repeats twice consecutively among the first twenty entries.
def norepeat(numlist):
  for n in range(1,min(20,len(numlist))):
    if numlist[n-1] == numlist[n]:
      return False
  return True

print(norepeat([1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]))
