##We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. 
##If n is even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all piles have an odd number of stones. 
##Each pile must more stones than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a Python program to find the number of stones in each pile
def stone_piles(n):
  piles = []
  for i in range(n):
    piles.append(n+i*2)
  return piles

print(stone_piles(10))
